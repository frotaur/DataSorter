========================= HOW TO USE ==================================

This is a small program to sort videos, according to 'how interesting' they are.

To run the program, simply run 'datasorter.exe'. If this is your first time, it will
ask if you want to download the videos. Press the download button to download them.
This may take up to 10 minutes depending on connection quality. The program will APPEAR
to be stuck, but it is not, it's because I did not implement a loading bar. Just wait,
it will 'unstick' itself when it finished downloading. If you want to check if it's
running, you can look at the command line window that opened, it should show download
speed and how many megabytes are downloaded.

When its done, you will be presented with two videos. You have the four buttons, which
are self explanatory. Press the button which corresponds to the video you find most 'interesting',
according to your own subjective assessment.

If you prefer using the keyboard :

- LEFT ARROW KEY : Prefer LEFT video
- RIGHT ARROW KEY : Prefer RIGHT video 
- BACKSPACE : Undo last choice.

When you are done, close the program. You can pick up later if you want.
When you think you've had enough, click on 'EXPORT RESULTS', and the program
will prompt you with a directory. Choose an appropriate directory and press OK.
This will save a file 'SENDME.json', which you can send to the following email :
