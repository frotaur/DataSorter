========================= HOW TO USE ==================================

This is a small program to sort videos, according to 'how interesting' they are.

To run the program, simply run 'datasorter.exe'.

You may get a warning from windows. If it asks to execute or unzip, choose execute.
If it tells you it was blocked because it is suspicious, choose something like 
'advanced options' and click 'run anyway'. (I promise it is not a virus).

If this is your first time, it will ask if you want to download the videos. 
Press the download button to download them. This may take up to 10 minutes 
depending on connection quality.

When its done, you will be presented with two videos. 

To navigate, click one of the four buttons, or use the associated shortcut :

- REPLAY FROM START (SPACEBAR) : restart videos, useful when they die quickly
- L/R More interesting (Left/Right ARROWKEY) : classify the Left(Right) video as more interesting
- UNDO (BACKSPACE) : Undo the last classification
- EXPORT RESULTS : choose folder to export results of classification, to send me.

Your job is to choose which video you find most 'interesting',according to your own subjective assessment. 
As a guideline, a video in which everything dies out very quickly should be considered as usually 
not very interesting. You are assessing how interesting the whole video is, so if its static for 
the most part, then it should usually be ranked as 'less interesting' that something that 
remain dynamic a longer time (even if it's not as pretty).

When you are done, close the program. You can pick up later if you want.
When you think you've had enough, click on 'EXPORT RESULTS', and the program
will prompt you with a directory. Choose an appropriate directory and press OK.
This will save a file 'SENDME.json', which you can send to the following email :
